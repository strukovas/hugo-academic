I have lived and worked in multiple countries, gaining a broad international perspective and global mindset. Exposure to diverse cultures and standards has shaped my adaptability, creativity, and problem-solving skills while fostering curiosity and a willingness to embrace challenges.

My career spans multiple fields, from artificial intelligence and computational linguistics to information retrieval and data-driven competency evaluation. My research explores how machine learning and data science can be used to assess skills and problem-solving approaches across different contexts. Through publications and hands-on projects, I continuously expand my knowledge, combining theory with practice to develop innovative solutions.

Beyond my professional work, I have a range of hobbies that enrich my life. I love cooking and baking, enjoy traveling, cross-stitching, and reading, and occasionally go hiking. I also have a passion for puzzles and board games. Most uniquely, I collect ducks.
