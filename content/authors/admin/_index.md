I was born and raised in the vibrant and historic city of Smolensk, Russia. Having lived and worked in various countries with diverse standards, I have cultivated a broad international perspective. The environment of my upbringing, paired with the unique experiences I have gained, has molded me into the creative and ambitious individual that I am today.

My career is a rich tapestry of diverse experiences across multiple domains, setting me apart as a polymath in a digital age. From delving into artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and information retrieval, to engaging in profound research endeavors at reputable institutions, I display a relentless pursuit of knowledge. The realms of artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and information retrieval are where my passion lies. Through my publications and hands-on projects, I have ventured into exploring new horizons, each endeavor adding a unique facet to my professional persona. Besides, my experience spans a wide range of topics, embodying a well-rounded and expansive skill set that seamlessly marries theory with practice, making her career not only diverse but also exceptionally robust and impactful.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I have a range of hobbies that enrich my life. I am a foodie at heart who loves to cook and bake. I enjoy travelling, cross-stitching and reading and though I am not a hiking pro, I do enjoy hitting the trails every now and then. I like puzzles and I am also quite active on CouchSurfing. Last but certainly not least, I have a unique passion for collecting ducks.
